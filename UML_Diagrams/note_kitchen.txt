There is a question in the assignment: "Is the kitchen an entity that you need to model in your class design?"

Our answer is that it does not neccessarily has to be there, but we included it. Our reasoning behind is that the cooks would have a display in the kitchen where they could make orders as finished. So that display would mostly be interacting with the Kitchen class.
